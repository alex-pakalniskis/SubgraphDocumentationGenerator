# Subgraph Overview
Everest has a GraphQL API endpoint hosted by [The Graph](https://thegraph.com/docs/about/introduction#what-the-graph-is) called a subgraph for indexing and organizing data from the Everest smart contracts. The code for our subgraph(s) can be found [here](https://github.com/graphprotocol/everest).

## Official subgraphs
Official subgraphs are subgraphs maintained by the Everest team.

| Smart Contract | Address | 
| --- | --- | 
| Everest | 0x445B774C012c5418d6D885f6cbfEB049a7FE6558 | 
| EthereumDIDRegistry | 0xdCa7EF03e98e0DC2B855bE647C39ABe984fcF21B | 

An [API key](https://thegraph.com/docs/en/querying/managing-api-keys/) needed is needed to query our Ethereum subgraph, as it's based on [The Graph](https://thegraph.com/)'s decentralized network. Replace [api-key] with your API key in the API endpoint. [Here](https://thegraph.com/docs/en/studio/managing-api-keys/) is a good guide on how to manage your API keys and set indexer preferences.
